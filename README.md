# SQL-housing-cleaning

This project focuses on SQL query-based data cleansing approaches. This project's dataset comprises several thousand rows of data on the Nashville housing market, which is also available on Kaggle.

Following actions were taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis:

1- Made the date format consistent across all rows.

2- Inserted NULL values into specific columns to ensure that all data is complete and correct.

3- distinct the addresses into distinct columns to make them simpler to read.

4- Removed duplicate rows to verify data is unique and correct.

5- Removed unnecessary columns that were not related to our analysis.

We obtained excellent skills in applying data cleaning techniques to real-world data throughout this process, and we prepared the dataset for future research. The end result is a clean, well-structured dataset suitable for further analysis and study.
